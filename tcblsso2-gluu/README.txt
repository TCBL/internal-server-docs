These are files to be put on the corresponding gluu server.
The path includes the location of the gluu container, as the script that puts the files to the server is run outside the container.

Important:
- before putting the files on the server, execute ./copy-and-adapt-common-files.sh!
- when adding files, prefer to add it in the ../common-gluu directory and extend ./copy-and-adapt-common-files.sh if needed!
